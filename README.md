# Dawn
This is a modified version of the official Dawn theme for Ghost, the source for this project can be found in the following [link](https://github.com/TryGhost/Dawn/archive/main.zip). Instead of forking the repo I decided to create a new one since I changed the logic of the theme in certain parts as a way of having a custom homepage that is editable inside the Ghost editor instead of having to write a custom homepage in HTML as it is usually required.

This theme was modified with the intent of making an online portfolio, because Ghost is usually intended to use as an Blogging platform, which allows for things like Memberships and having users, however I deleted everything related to that from the theme and disabled the membership functionality inside my Ghost admin dashboard. Since this is a temporary web portfolio I have no need for such things, I just needed a platform that allows me to write some posts and edit them with ease.

If you want to customize a theme to have a custom homepage like I do you can follow this [guide](https://jamesthorne.com/blog/adding-a-custom-homepage-on-ghost/) to replicate my results. And finally I would like to leave a disclaimer since the only experience I have with handlebars is building this theme, there can be issues and certain files that are not required.

You can see what the theme looks like in my web portfolio in [here](https://www.filipefigueiredo.xyz)
